	  This project contains two utilities for running a MCTP network from
	  the local machine:
	  
	    * mctp: A small command-line utility to query and manage the state
	      of the kernel MCTP stack, in a similar way to iproute2's ip utility.
	  
	    * mctpd: A daemon implementing the MCTP control protocol; you'll
	      need this for the local host to perform as a bus-owner. The main
	      function of mctpd is to assign EIDs to remote endpoints, and
	      manage the resulting routes and neighbour-table entries for those
	      endpoints.
